            mission is to provide children in foster care with enriching outdoor
            adventures, invaluable mentorships, and a year round community,
            where youth are given opportunities to develop leadership skills and
            prepare for life after foster care. Nearly one hundred times a day,
            a child in California is placed in foster care because of severe
            abuse or neglect. Happy Trails for Kids believes that fostering
            continuity and belonging through extracurricular activity is a
            critical intervention in combating the challenges of foster care and
            promoting success.

            </span>
            is a non-profit organization that donates makeup and hygiene
            products to female refugees. By donating these items, they aim to
            help these women maintain their dignity, a sense of normalcy, give a
            bit of hope, and as a result, promote emotional and mental
            well-being. In 2016, they volunteered to assist with the Syrian
            refugee crisis. While handing out donations, two women pulled them
            aside and shyly asked them if they had any makeup. They were struck
            by this request, and it continued to resonate with them after they
            came home. Providing food, shelter and clothing in crisis situations
            is essential, but they also realized that there is a need for goods
            that help provide something equally important, which is one's
            dignity.

            </span>
            has raised more than 20 million dollars and has supported over 30
            groundbreaking cancer clinical trials and treatments. Alberto Valner
            and his mother were both diagnosed with very different types of
            cancer within days of each other. At the time, little was known
            about his mother's type of cancer. She passed away within days of
            Alberto being told he was "all clear" and cancer-free. Alberto and
            his wife Stacy, this experience galvanized them to act and PHASE ONE
            was founded. They gathered a small group of friends in Los Angeles
            to support early cancer research. Their mission was to find
            treatments that will transform what might be terminal illness into
            hope for a full and productive life.

            partners with a national network of leading programs to break the
            cycle of family poverty through the power of donated goods and
            services. Founded in 2001 by Jessica Seinfeld shortly after the
            birth of her first child. 16 years later, they have donated almost
            35 million items to a national network of over 155 antipoverty
            programs. Pom Pom at Home was glad to donate over $30k retail worth
            of baby bedding and pillowcases, many of which went to help the
            families from Hurricane Harvey.
